euFUN.Key1001.title = "for any curse or excommunication incurred by the departed, read by the Hierarch"
euFUN.Key1002.text = "Lord our God, in Your ineffable wisdom You fashioned Adam out of the dust, which You transformed in appearance and beauty; and because You made him in Your image and according to Your likeness, You adorned him as a precious and heavenly possession, for the praise and majesty of Your glory and kingdom. Then he transgressed the commandment You enjoined him to keep. Having partaken of Your image, he did not preserve it. For this reason, so that evil might not become immortal, You, the God of our fathers, benevolently decreed that this composition and mixture, this unbreakable bond that You made, should be severed and dissolved, according to Your divine will. And thus, until the general resurrection, the soul goes to where it received its existence, and the body disintegrates into the elements from which it was composed. Therefore we pray You, the unoriginate Father, and Your only-begotten Son, and Your all-holy, consubstantial and life-giving Spirit: Please do not ignore the work of Your hands and allow it to be swallowed up by perdition, but let the body decompose, and let the soul be assigned a place in the choir of the righteous. Yes, O Lord our God, let Your infinite mercy and ineffable benevolence prevail. And if any of these Your servants came under the curse of father or mother, or cursed themselves, or if they provoked any of the clergy and received a penance, from which they were not released, or if they incurred a severe excommunication of a hierarch, and then through indifference or negligence failed to obtain forgiveness, we pray You forgive them now through me, Your sinful and unworthy servant. Let their bodies decompose, and place their souls in the dwellings of the saints. Yes indeed, O Lord our God, You gave Your holy Disciples and Apostles this authority, to grant forgiveness of sins, and You told them that whatever they would bind and loose would indeed be bound and loosed. And in Your benevolence You have conveyed through them this same tremendous gift to us, unworthy though we be. Therefore we pray: Loose from every sin of soul and body these Your departed servant(s), (names,) and may they be forgiven, both in the present time and in the age to come, through the intercessions of Your all-pure and ever-virgin Mother and of all the saints."

euFUN.Key1003.text = "Merciful Master, Lord Jesus Christ our God, who bestowed on your holy Disciples and sacred Apostles, after your holy resurrection on the third day, the keys of the kingdom of heaven and, by your grace, the authority to bind and loose the sins of humankind, so that what was bound by them on earth was also bound in heaven, and what was loosed by them on earth was also loosed in heaven, and, in your inex-pressible loving kindness, made us, your poor and unworthy servants, worthy to be successors to this same most holy gift and grace from you, so that we also might bind and loose when the occasion arises among your people: forgive, King of all goodness, through me your lowly and unworthy servant, your servant (name), if in this life, like any human being, he (she) has committed any offence; pardon any sin he (she)has committed in word, deed or thought, re-leasing him (her) also from any bond lying upon him (her) by any means at all, whether he (she)has bound himself (herself) out of a reckless impulse or from some other cause, or, whether in the sight of a hierarch or any other person, he (she) has fallen into error, through the envy and collusion of the Evil One; be pleased, as the only good and merciful one, that his (her)soul be placed with the Saints who in every age have been pleasing to you, and that his (her)body be restored to its original nature created by you. For blessed and glorified are you to the ages."
